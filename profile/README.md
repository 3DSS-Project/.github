# 3DSS Project

This organization is the LM 3DSS project. All repositories have been adapted for ROS1 Noetic and will soon be adapted to ROS2 Humble Hawksbill.

The repositories for full demonstration are:

Internally made:
1) hunter_robot
2) cu_osm
3) ce_net_ros

External, but adjusted:
5) ros_numpy (ce_net_ros depends on it)
6) sc_lio_sam
7) octomap_mapping (set to display colored maps)
